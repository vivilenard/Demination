# Plan
Which one to implement first?
Supabase is the basic database. The rest is optional.
The learning curve for RxDB is significantly steeper than TanStack Query. I recommend this order:

### PWA
Start with the PWA plugin: Get the app "installable" on your phone first.

### TanStack Query
Add TanStack Query: Use it for your To-Do list and Weekly Plan. This gives you the "Optimistic" feel and background syncing.

### RxDB
Advanced (RxDB): Only move to RxDB if you find that TanStack Query isn't robust enough for long periods of offline use (like multiple days without signal).
